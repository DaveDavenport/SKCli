Console Stuffkeeper
===================

The base idea
-------------

Lately I find the console to be more useful then GUIs.
Therefor I decided to write a CLI version of the tool.
It will be based on Task Warrior.

The SK world exists of the following elements:

* *Type*: Specification of an item.
* *Item*: An instance of a type.
* *Tag*:  A identifier that items can be associated to.

So, an Item is an instance of a Type and can be associated with one or more Tags.

Type
----

A type described what fields are allows in the type. 
While technically there is no reason to limit the fields of an Item to a fixed set, it is 
in place to enforce order.

How to create a type using the CLI is not yet clear. The idea is that you need to 
specify a set of fields, order of the fields and the type (number, text, date, boolean, etc.).


Item
----

An item is based on a 'type', the 'type' specifies witch fields it has.
A item can have 'tags' attached.

An item consists of the following default fields:

[width="50%",cols="1,2", options="header"]
|=====================================
| Field              | Description
| UID                | A unique id to identify the item
| Creation date      | Timestamp when item was created.
| Modification date  | Timestamp the item was last edited.
| Title              | The title of item, this could be markup string with key elements.
|=====================================

The rest of the fields are defined by 'type'.


Tag
---

Items can be searched,filtered based on tags.

An example of a tag could be: Jazz, MusicBox1, Gadget, etc.

Tags can be renamed and removed (if no longer linked to an item).


Proposed API
------------

Adding an item
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To add an item you need to specify a name and a type.
The command looks like:

[source,bash]
--------------
skcli add <type> <name> +<tag> +<tag>
--------------

On addition the item gets a unique id and the creation date is set.

Setting type specific options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can set properties, using the set-property command. 
The '<key>' should be part of the type.

[source,bash]
----------------
skcli set-property <uid> <key>:<value>
----------------
